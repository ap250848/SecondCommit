To support multiple calls to HSM operations using a loop, you can modify the script to iterate a specified number of times. Here's an updated version of the script with support for multiple hits using a loop:

```python
import sys
import socket
from struct import *

TCP_IP = '10.4.100.98'
TCP_PORT = 12345  # Change this to the port number you need
BUFFER_SIZE = 1024

def connect_to_hsm():
    try:
        hsmsocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        hsmsocket.connect((TCP_IP, TCP_PORT))
        return hsmsocket
    except socket.error as err:
        print(f"Socket error: {err}")
        sys.exit(1)

def send_command(socket, command):
    try:
        size = pack('>h', len(command))
        message = size + command
        socket.send(message)
        data = socket.recv(BUFFER_SIZE)
        return data.decode('utf-8')
    except socket.error as err:
        print(f"Error sending/receiving data: {err}")
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hsmsocket = connect_to_hsm()

    while True:
        print("Select an HSM operation:")
        print("1. Operation 1")
        print("2. Operation 2")
        print("3. Quit")
        
        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == '1':
            command = b'Command for Operation 1'
        elif choice == '2':
            command = b'Command for Operation 2'
        elif choice == '3':
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            continue

        HSMTxnCount = int(input("Enter the number of times to hit HSM: "))
        print(f"Total transaction count for {choice} is {HSMTxnCount}")

        for _ in range(HSMTxnCount):
            response = send_command(hsmsocket, command)
            print(f"Response from HSM for {choice}:", response)

    hsmsocket.close()
```

In this updated script:

- After selecting an HSM operation, the script prompts the user to enter the number of times they want to hit the HSM with that specific operation.

- The for loop then performs the specified HSM operation the specified number of times, sending the command and receiving the response for each iteration.

- The loop continues until the user chooses to quit (option 3).

- You can customize the IP address (`TCP_IP`), port number (`TCP_PORT`), commands, and operation-specific logic as needed.

This modification allows you to repeatedly execute a specific HSM operation multiple times, making it easier to perform performance testing or stress testing on the HSM.
